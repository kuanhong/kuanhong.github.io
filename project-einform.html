            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>
              At PSA Corporation, safety incident reporting was traditionally done on paper or desktop systems at the
              end of each
              shift. This led to <strong>delayed submissions, incomplete data, and slower safety responses</strong>. I
              designed and developed eInform,
              a mobile application that enables operators to log incidents immediately and accurately while on-site —
              even in harsh operational conditions.
            </p>
            <p>
              Another key focus was on <strong>human factors and ergonomics</strong>, ensuring the interface aligned
              with how operators
              physically interacted with devices while wearing gloves, working under bright sunlight, or multitasking in
              noisy environments.

          <h2 class="py-3">Designing for the Real World: eInform, a Safety Incident Reporting App for Port Operators
          </h2>
          <p>When I joined PSA Corporation, one of the first challenges I noticed was how <strong>safety incident
              reporting</strong> was still largely manual. Operators working on the ground, sometimes under
            scorching sun or in noisy dock environments and had to remember details from earlier in their shifts and
            type them into a desktop system later in the day.</p>
          <p>The result? Delayed or incomplete reports, missed follow-ups, and slower responses from safety teams.</p>
          <p>That&rsquo;s how <em>eInform</em> was born &mdash; a mobile app designed to let operators <strong>report
              incidents instantly and accurately</strong>, right where they happen.</p>

          <hr class="border-bottom border-1 border-dark">
          <h3 class="py-3">Understanding the Environment: More Than Just a &ldquo;User&rdquo; Problem</h3>
          <p>Before I even opened Figma, I went into the field. I shadowed port operators through their daily routines:
            walking alongside them in container yards, observing how they interacted with their tools, and paying
            attention to their physical environment.</p>
          <p>It quickly became clear that this wasn&rsquo;t just a <strong>UI problem</strong> &mdash; it was also an
            <strong>ergonomic and human factors</strong> problem.
          </p>
          <p>Operators were often wearing gloves, handling heavy machinery, or working under bright sunlight. They
            couldn&rsquo;t be expected to type lengthy descriptions or navigate complex menus. They also had limited
            connectivity at certain berths, meaning any solution had to <strong>work offline</strong> and sync later.
          </p>
          <p>These observations shaped one of the most important design goals for <em>eInform</em>:</p>
          <blockquote>
            <code>
            To create an app that fits into the user&rsquo;s physical workflow, not the other way around.
          </code>
          </blockquote>

          <hr class="border-bottom border-1 border-dark">
          <h3 class="py-3">Defining the Challenge</h3>
          <p>After collecting insights from field observations and informal interviews, I defined the core problem:</p>
          <blockquote>
            <code>How might we enable port operators to report incidents quickly and accurately, without disrupting
              their operational flow or compromising safety?</code>
          </blockquote>
          <p>From there, I mapped out the workflow and pinpointed where friction occurred &mdash; during typing,
            navigating between screens, and waiting for slow uploads.</p>
          <p>I also worked with PSA&rsquo;s safety officers to identify what data truly mattered in the first moments of
            reporting, such as location, time, type of incident, and severity. That helped keep the design focused and
            avoid unnecessary complexity.</p>

          <hr class="border-bottom border-1 border-dark">


          <h3 class="py-3">Ideation: Designing for Context and Constraint</h3>
          <p>During brainstorming, I explored several concepts with both the safety and engineering teams. Some early
            sketches revolved around:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p><strong>Photo-first reporting:</strong> letting users take a quick photo to describe the incident
                instead of writing.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p><strong>Auto-location capture:</strong> using GPS to tag the report automatically.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p><strong>One-tap categorization:</strong> allowing users to classify the type of incident with large,
                glove-friendly buttons.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p><strong>Offline-first architecture:</strong> enabling reports to be saved and synced once back online.
              </p>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>These ideas weren&rsquo;t just about convenience&mdash;they were about designing <strong>for the human body
              and environment</strong>. I considered how operators held their phones (often one-handed), where their
            thumbs naturally rested, and how glare could affect visibility.</p>
          <p>I also referred to <strong>ergonomic design principles</strong> for handheld devices, ensuring that touch
            targets met minimum size guidelines and that contrast ratios supported readability in outdoor lighting.</p>

          <hr />
          <h3 class="py-3">Prototyping and Testing</h3>
          <p>Once the key concepts were aligned, I created low-fidelity prototypes to validate the reporting flow.</p>
          <p>The design used <strong>a clean, high-contrast color palette</strong> (navy blue, white, and safety orange)
            and <strong>minimal navigation depth</strong>&mdash;operators could start a report within one tap from the
            home screen.</p>
          <p>Each step of the reporting process was simplified:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <p><strong>Capture Photo</strong> &mdash; A single, large camera button made it easy to snap a picture
                while wearing gloves.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p><strong>Add Quick Details</strong> &mdash; Operators selected incident type and severity through big,
                clear buttons.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p><strong>Review &amp; Submit</strong> &mdash; A summary view allowed users to double-check and send
                instantly, with an option to &ldquo;Save for Later&rdquo; if interrupted.</p>
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>I then tested the prototype with a small group of port operators in real working conditions.</p>
          <p>The results were encouraging:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>Report submission time dropped from 15 minutes to under 1 minute.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Operators found the larger buttons more comfortable to use with gloves.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Automatic location capture eliminated repetitive typing.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Even in bright sunlight, the interface remained legible.</p>
            </li>
          </ul>

          <hr class="border-bottom border-1 border-dark">
          <h3 class="py-3">Designing for Human Factors and Ergonomics</h3>
          <p>One of the most interesting aspects of this project was integrating <strong>human factors</strong> into the
            design process.</p>
          <p>We often talk about empathy in UX, but empathy isn&rsquo;t just emotional&mdash;it&rsquo;s also
            <strong>physical</strong>. Observing how people use their hands, how they shift their weight, and how they
            interact with their environment can reveal design opportunities you won&rsquo;t find in interviews alone.
          </p>
          <p>By acknowledging these factors early, I was able to design an interface that felt <em>natural</em> in
            context&mdash;one that respected the limitations and demands of real-world use.</p>

          <hr class="border-bottom border-1 border-dark">
          <h3 class="py-3">Impact</h3>
          <p>After rollout, <em>eInform</em> significantly improved the speed and completeness of incident reports.
            Safety teams began receiving reports in near real-time, allowing them to respond faster and with better
            situational awareness.</p>
          <p>The tool also encouraged a <strong>culture of proactive safety reporting</strong>, since operators no
            longer felt burdened by the process. The app fit seamlessly into their workflow&mdash;it worked
            <em>with</em> them, not <em>against</em> them.
          </p>

          <hr class="border-bottom border-1 border-dark">
          <h3 class="py-3">Reflection</h3>
          <p>Looking back, <em>eInform</em> was one of the most rewarding projects I&rsquo;ve worked on because it
            combined <strong>technical, environmental, and human challenges</strong> into one design.</p>
          <p>It reminded me that good UX isn&rsquo;t only about screens&mdash;it&rsquo;s about context, ergonomics, and
            empathy. Designing for users in controlled environments is one thing; designing for users who operate heavy
            machinery in sunlight and noise is something else entirely.</p>
          <p>This project reaffirmed my passion for creating products that sit at the intersection of <strong>physical
              and digital design</strong>, where usability is measured not just in clicks, but in comfort, safety, and
            real-world impact.</p>
